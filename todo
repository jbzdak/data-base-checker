1. Enable many PartialGrades for single GradePart in this case we should
   only take one with hightest value
1a .this will mess with editing grades by hand,
    so we need to add a swithc to GradePart that will enavle either taking
    latest PartialGrade or hightest (in which case we need to emit error
    to user that tries to lower the grade)
1b. Store user that saved particular PartialGrade (will increase transparency)
2. Enable 'coures' functionality. Course would be the same as Group but
   studdent (account) would be allowed to have many courses.
3. Add detailed grading information that displays grade parts.
